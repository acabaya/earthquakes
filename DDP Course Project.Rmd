## Introduction
This project utilize the Shiny and Leaflet Package to map out gloablly the significant earthquakes from 1800 to 2017. Although the database originally contains earthquakes from 2015B.C. to 2017, this project only focus on the last 2 centuries of earthquake data. 


## The Data Set
The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 2150 B.C. to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.

Data set Source:
National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): Significant Earthquake Database. National Geophysical Data Center, NOAA. 
[database link](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1)

*The dataset was also cleaned to remove the events with missing or invalid data.*

## Input Selection
The project uses the Shiny fackage to filter out the earthquake events from the following variables:

* Year in Range (1800-2017) using a `sliderInput`
* Earthquake Magnitude (1.0 to 10.0) using a `sliderInput`
* Region as classified by NGDC using a `selectInput`
* A drop down list using `selectInput` for the selection of the color of the marker:
    + Tsunami Event, Year, Focal Depth, Intensity (MMI), Deaths, Damage(M$), Houses Destroyed

## Display

This project also uses the leaflet package to map out the epicenters of the earthquake event and shows the magnitude by the size of the marker.

Histogram of magnitude and occurence by year of the events showed in the map are also provided.
